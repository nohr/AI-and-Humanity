               <p>California saw major destruction in 2017 due to the onslaught of wildfires. More than 1 million acres worth of land was reported burned in wildfires that claimed the lives of 85 people with 249 people listed as missing. Due to the threats of climate change, more and more companies are now embracing artificial intelligence to fight disasters with algorithms. They warn us in a timely manner with enough room to organize ourselves in the face of an impending disaster and minimize loss. - Interesting Engineering <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/7-ways-ai-will-help-humanity-not-harm-it">Link</a></p>

               <p>Artificial Intelligence can also be considered a boon to humanity given the fact that it liberates humans and allows them to perform tasks in which they excel. While we are capable of logic and reason, we are also wonderfully creative. When machines automate the mundane and routine tasks, we will have more time, energy, and attention for the so-called “right-brain” thinking that machines are currently not good at, such as holistic thinking, empathy, creativity, and musicality. - Interesting Engineering <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/7-ways-ai-will-help-humanity-not-harm-it">Link</a></p>
